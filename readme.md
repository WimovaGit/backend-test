# Background

You just joined a team and your first job is to refactor an existing class. 
You are alone on this and you may not ask to anyone any help except the given code.
This class is part of a Symfony 2/3/4 project, but that doesn't matter.

## Instructions
Give a list of prioritised issues that need to be refactored from the most important to the less valuable, and justify your choices.
